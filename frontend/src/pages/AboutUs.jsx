  Ray-Ban has been a major target. It has been proven time and time again that
  fake websites selling  knockoff goods are linked to Ray-Ban advertisements featuring
  absurdly low costs. <br /> According to studies, Facebook users are directed to these websites
  by one out of every four adverts for reduced luxury goods Ray-Bans are frequently involved. 
<br /><br />
  In order to stop the sale of imitation goods, Luxottica has taken a number of steps, including
  turning the India Ray-Ban website from a reference site into a working <br /> e-commerce platform and
  bringing legal action against online merchants who sell imitation  Ray-Ban products. In agreements
  with their wholesale clients, Luxottica instituted a Ray-Ban policy in 2016. 

  <br/>Although the policy does not specify a minimum price point, it prohibits the promotion of Ray-Ban
  items at steep discounts as well as other forms of advertising that may otherwise diminish the value
  of the goods.
